    <meta name="description" content="This analysis discusses the public debate on abortion in Argentina and Mexico using data from newspapers and Twitter. Abortion laws continue to be very restrictive across Latin America and the legalisation of abortion is often framed as a demand by national feminist movements. In Argentina, abortion was legalised in December 2020, whereas Mexico has a very fragmented, restrictive legal system. The collected data and different types of analysis including topic modelling, demography analysis, and semantic network mapping offer an overview of the ongoing debate and the key differences between the two countries, which include, for example, the prominence and fragmentation of the debate in both countries. The analysis indicates that Argentina might have a more unified and active pro-abortion movement than Mexico, which also explains their recent legislative success."/>

This analysis discusses the public debate on abortion in Argentina and Mexico using data from newspapers and Twitter. Abortion laws continue to be very restrictive across Latin America and the legalisation of abortion is often framed as a demand by national feminist movements. In Argentina, abortion was legalised in December 2020, whereas Mexico has a very fragmented, restrictive legal system. The collected data and different types of analysis including topic modelling, demography analysis, and semantic network mapping offer an overview of the ongoing debate and the key differences between the two countries, which include, for example, the prominence and fragmentation of the debate in both countries. The analysis indicates that Argentina might have a more unified and active pro-abortion movement than Mexico, which also explains their recent legislative success.
